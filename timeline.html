                        <p>After looking at server hosting providers. I decided to try and make a basic login function with hard-coded details. (Unsuccessful)</p>
                        <p>Update: Due to how web browsers are set up, it's pretty much impossible to create a HTTP to HTTPS connection. This is mainly due to the CORS Policy (Cross-origin resource sharing) which is designed to stop this type of connection.</p>

                        <p>Update: After looking for the issue for nearly 6 hours, the reason was that I attempted to make a glossary for my backend code. However it appears that it does not like the file name "glossary.txt"</p>
